This was given as a freebe so I just ran the code. using ./0
1.
I ran ltrace on 1 and saw that rand returned a number in hex 0x6695e815 so after converting it to decimal 1721100309.
I ran the code and got the correct secret.
2.
Running ltrace on 2 shows that it returned 0. searching the function on google it shows that
when curl_easy_perform is run succesfully it's CURLE_OK.
3.
running ltrace shows its missing a file called "iamspecial", so i added the file but got the error for not having
the right persmission. I used the command chmod +rwx iamspecial to give it all the persmission.
4.
When i ran the code it showed that i am missing a shared library so I created a shared library and to not run
the code to make it everytime i created a makefile with 
    gcc -c -Wall -Werror -fpic lib361.c
	gcc -shared -o lib361.so lib361.o
Then, ran it again but it crashed. So i ran it in ltrace, which showed me i needed two paremeters.
but the return result was the two variables +1 so i created a int function which returned the sum of
the two variables +1.
int secretoperation(int x, int y) {
    return x+y+1;
}
